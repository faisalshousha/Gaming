  <h2 id="about" >ABOUT</h2>
  <p>This website is about my love for gamig. I have started gaming since Windows 98, when games looked very ugly. My brothers and I had one CD that had all the games we played. We had to share the gaming time because back then it was only one computer for the whole family, it was not common to have many computers. This was not a great gaming experience but it started our love for gaming.</p><br>
    
  <p>As time went on, I watched the gaming technology getting better and better. I have been always impressed with the evolution of game graphics and mechanics. Games started from 2D graphics to realistic graphics. Graphics is a big factor when I decide to try a video games. I decide 80% on gameplay and 20% on graphics. I am excited to see what game graphics will look like 10 years from now.</p><br>
    
  <p>Currently, gaming is a daily routine in my life. I spend all my free time gaming non-stop. My favorite types of games are competitive fps games and soccer games, but I try games that look interesting to me. I am not the most skilled in competitive games, but everyday I try to improve my skills because gaming is what I love.</p><br>

    <h2>GAMES</h2>
    <p>Throughout my gaming experience, Battlefield 4 and Rainbow Six Siege are my all-time favorite multiplayer games. Both games combine great graphics and gameplay. Both games are highly rated among gamers.</p><br>
      
    <p>I have started playing battlefield 4 in 9th grade, when school was easy and boring. This game made my life amazing. I have played it day and night without getting bored. Every gamer would say the same about it. It was just a perfectly executed game. My total play time on Battlefield 4 was about 1000 hours. Then when school became harder I didn't have time to play much. After that the game started getting fewer players because of how much time they spent on and because newer games came out.</p><br>
      
    <p>Currently, Rainbow Six Siege is my daily game of choice. It is the competetive fps game that will replace Counter Strike in the ESPORT theme. I enjoy its style of combat and how it relies heavily on sound. Additionally, I like how the team with more map knowledge and experience will win most of the times. Sometimes luck is involved, but the game relies on knowledge the most. I play this game with the goal of improving my skills. I don't think this game will die any time soon.</p><br>

    <h2>MY SETUP &amp; SPECS</h2>   
    <p>I have had a really horrible laptop throughout my high school days. When I gamed on it I got 60FPS barely. I had to replace the fan and heatsink from overheating. I also had to change thermal paste twice. I hated that laptop so much. Then I had to plan and get a new laptop. While gaming computer would've costed less, buying a laptop is better because the apartment is too small.</p><br>
        
    <p>I have waited untill the 2017 Black Friday. My brother found a good deal on the Asus Strix GL703VM (the specs are below). It was a really exciting day when I bought it. I could finally play more games that were hard to run on my old laptop. This is when I started playing Rainbow Six Siege.</p><br>
        
     <p>This laptop can run most current games at 100FPS or higher which is enough for now. One day, as games become more demanding, I will upgrade it. I will save money for the next upgrade. My mouse is Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum. My mousepad is QCK. Finally, my best accessory is the Sennheiser HD598SR headset; which has really good sound detail that I need for Rainbow Six (pictures in the 'GALLERY' section).</p><br>
